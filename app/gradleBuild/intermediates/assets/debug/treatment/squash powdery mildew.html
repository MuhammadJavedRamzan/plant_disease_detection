	<h1>Squash powdery mildew Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>Along with the perfect storm of weather conditions, we no doubt aided and abetted the disease. As mentioned above, the disease overwinters. Practicing a crop rotation will go a long way in preventing the spread of powdery mildew. Do not plant cucurbits in the same area for at least two years. We did not practice crop rotation; I blame my other half. Additional management techniques for treating powdery mildew in squash are to destroy any diseased plant debris, space plantings since a densely planted plot is more likely to be infected, and plant resistant varieties when possible. Also, keep the garden free of weeds. Powdery mildew control may also be need to be combined with a timely application of a fungicide. When using fungicides, it&rsquo;s too late for them to be of any use once symptoms become rampant. Fungicides work by preventing infection of healthy foliage, so find the infection early. There are a number of organic options available as well as traditional fungal sprays. Sulfur and &ldquo;Stylet&rdquo; oil are effective products for powdery mildew control. Fixed copper fungicides have also shown results in managing powdery mildew. Neem oil is also an effective combatant for managing powdery mildew.</p>
