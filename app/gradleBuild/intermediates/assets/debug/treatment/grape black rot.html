	<h1>Grape black rot Treatment:</h1>
	<p>Grape black rot is difficult to stop once it has taken hold of growing fruit.Many gardeners would consider this year's crop a lost cause and work toward preventing a recurrence of disease.</p>
<p>The best time to treat black rot of grapes is between bud break until about four weeks after bloom; treating outside of this window is likely to end in frustration. However, if you want to try, captan and myclobutanil are the fungicides of choice.</p>
<p>Prevention is key when dealing with grape black rot. During your fall clean-up, make sure that all mummies have been removed from the vine and all plant material on the ground below is destroyed. Prune out any and all areas with lesions, grapevines can handle a severe pruning when in doubt, cut it out. If leaves appear the following spring with new lesions, remove these immediately and start a spray treatment program with one of the above-listed fungicides.</p>
