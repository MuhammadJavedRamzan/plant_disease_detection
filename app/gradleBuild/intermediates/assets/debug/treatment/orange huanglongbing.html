	<h1>Orange huanglongbing Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>In areas where the psyllid is newly arrived, or residential citrus is close to commercial citrus, the CDFA is conducting residential insecticide treatments to control the psyllid. When a psyllid is found in these areas, all citrus and other ACP host plants on a property and nearby properties receive a combination of two insecticides. This consists of a foliar pyrethroid insecticide to quickly kill adults and immature psyllids by direct contact, followed by a systemic (ground drench) insecticide to provide sustained control of nymphs tucked inside young leaves. This combination of treatment may protect trees against psyllids for up to 3 months. Home gardeners are encouraged to be vigilant and consider supplementary applications of their own when they see psyllids on new flush.</p>
<p>Because of the threat ACP poses to both backyard and commercial citrus and the urgency of containing this pest, home gardeners outside the areas that are part of the CDFA residential treatment program are encouraged to consider implementing psyllid control measures of their own if psyllids are found.</p>
<p>Home gardeners can hire a landscape pest control professional to apply insecticides, or make treatments themselves. Landscape professionals have access to the same pesticides applied by the CDFA, which include the systemic imidacloprid and foliar applications of the pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin.</p>
<p>Home gardeners can apply broad-spectrum foliar sprays (carbaryl, malathion) to rapidly control adults and protect plants for many weeks. The systemic insecticide imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Fruit, Citrus &amp; Vegetable and other products) is available for use as a soil drench, which moves through the roots to the growing tissues of the plant. This systemic insecticide provides good control (1&ndash;2 months) of the nymphs, which are hard to reach with sprays because they are tucked inside the small leaves of new flush growth.</p>
<p>Apply the soil drench during summer or fall when roots are active. Broad-spectrum foliar sprays and the systemic insecticide are toxic to honey bees, so don't apply them when the citrus trees are blooming.</p>
<p>There are also a number of organic and "soft" foliar insecticides such as oils and soaps (horticultural spray oil, neem oil, insecticidal soap) that can help to reduce psyllids. These insecticides are generally lower in risk to beneficial insects (natural enemies and pollinators); however, they are also less persistent so applications need to be made frequently when psyllids are observed (every 7-14 days). Oil and soap insecticides must make direct contact with the psyllid so should be applied carefully to achieve full coverage of the tree. See the "Active Ingredients Compare Risks" button for more information about potential hazards posed by these materials.</p>
<p>Treatment Considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>Always follow label instructions for the&nbsp;safe&nbsp;and effective use of the product.</li>
<li>Only apply pesticides if psyllids have been observed.</li>
<li>Only apply insecticides to host plants of psyllids (citrus and closely related hosts).</li>
<li>Avoid using insecticides during bloom to limit impacts on bees.</li>
<li>Thoroughly wet the foliage when spraying, including undersides of leaves.</li>
</ul>
