	<h1>Grape leaf blight Treatment:</h1>

		<p>Grapevines have specific cultural requirements. When these are met, most vines perform beautifully with few problems. Grapes perform best if grown in well-drained soil with plenty of organic amendment. Most grape varieties are hardy in USDA zones 3 to 8, but some prefer cooler weather, while others need a longer warmer season. Annual pruning is key to preventing problems in grapes. Train young canes to just one strong leader, with peripheral shoots coming off that and tied to a trellis.</p>
