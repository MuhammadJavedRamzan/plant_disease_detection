	<h1>Potato late blight Treatment:</h1>
	<p>
		<ol>
<li>Plant resistant cultivars when available.</li>
<li>Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.</li>
<li>Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses , to give plants time to dry out during the day &mdash; avoid overhead irrigation.</li>
<li>Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup).</li>
</ol>
<p>If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the following fungicides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply a copper based fungicide &nbsp;(2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so&nbsp;that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.</li>
<li>Used as a foliar spray, Organocide&reg; Plant Doctorm &nbsp;will work its way through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix&nbsp;2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2&nbsp;week&nbsp;intervals as required to control disease.</li>
<li>Safely treat fungal problems&nbsp;with&nbsp; SERENADE Garden . This&nbsp;broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of&nbsp;<em>Bacillus subtilis</em>&nbsp;and is approved for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE&nbsp;is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.</li>
<li> Monterey All Natural Disease Controlis a ready-to-use blend of naturally occurring ingredients that control most plant foliar diseases. All stages of the disease is controlled, but applying before infestation gives the best results.</li>
</ul>
