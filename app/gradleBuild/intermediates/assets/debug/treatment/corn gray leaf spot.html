	<h1>Corn gray leaf spot Treatment:</h1>
	<p>An effective gray leaf spot disease control program involves the integration of a number of cultural practices. Growers who have experienced the disease would be wise to critically reevaluate their corn production practices in order to avoid significant yield losses.</p>
<h4>Tillage Practices</h4>
<p>Tillage, the turning of corn residues, is beneficial in reducing pathogen survival and inoculum for the succeeding corn crop. The burial of infested debris facilitates rotting and deprives the fungus of a food base. The fungus is unable to survive freely within the soil. It can only overwinter within and on dead corn tissue remaining on or above the soil surface. Disking does not sufficiently bury the infested debris. Mold board plowing does, but it may not be advisable in some fields because of increased erosion potential. Erosion potential can be reduced by fall plowing and seeding to a winter cover crop, followed by no-till planting of corn in the spring. Burial of infested debris, however, may not provide an effective means of reducing gray leaf spot inoculum in regions where widespread use of conservation tillage is practiced because the pathogen may blow into a field from adjacent fields.</p>
<h4>Crop Rotation</h4>
<p>Taking a field out of corn production or rotating to a non-host crop for one year can reduce gray leaf spot severity. The fungus is unable to survive more than one season in infested corn debris. Corn is the only crop this fungus is known to attack. However, the potential for herbicide carryover may restrict the selection of crops in the rotation scheme.</p>
<h4>Corn Silage Production</h4>
<p>Growing corn ensilage significantly reduces the amount of inoculum available for infecting the next corn crop in two ways. First, silage corn is usually harvested before significant blighting from gray leaf spot occurs, thereby reducing the amount of the pathogen available to survive the winter months. Secondly, removal of corn for ensilage leaves only about six inches of stalk in the ground. This practice leaves little, if any, infested debris for overwintering of the fungus.</p>
