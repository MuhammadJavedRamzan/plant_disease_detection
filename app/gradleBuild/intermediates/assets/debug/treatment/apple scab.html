	<h1>Apple scab Treatment:</h1>
	
	<ol>
<li>Choose resistant varieties when possible.</li>
<li>Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.</li>
<li>Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.</li>
<li>Spread a 3- to 6-inch&nbsp;layer of compost&nbsp;under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.</li>
<li>For best control, spray&nbsp;liquid copper soap&nbsp;early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.</li>
<li>Bonide Sulfur Plant Fungicide,&nbsp;a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply&nbsp;from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.</li>
<li>Organocide Plant Doctor&nbsp;is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that&nbsp;works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number&nbsp;of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.</li>
<li>Containing&nbsp;sulfur and pyrethrins,&nbsp;Bonide Orchard Spray&nbsp;is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If&nbsp;disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.</li>
