	<h1>Tomato leaf mold< treatment:</h1>
		<p>When you notice the infected areas, the first thing you can do is let the plants air out. If they are being grown in a green house, air exposure is a must, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive is dried up.</p>
<p>If the tomatoes are being grown outside, try to keep from wetting the leaves when you are watering the plants. When you water the plants, earlier watering is optimal because it allows the plant time to dry when the sun comes, keeping humidity around leaves to a minimum.</p>
<p>Another option for treatment is fungacide sprays. When using these sprays, be sure to cover each part of the plant that is above ground, paying special attention to the underside of the leaf. Some of the most widely recommended sprays are those containing calcium chloride. There are some organic fungicides available as well.</p>
<p>Some remedies that can be mixed up right in your kitchen include an apple-cider and vinegar mix to treat the mold. Corn and garlic spray can be used to prevent the fungi outbreaks before they even occur. A milk spray is also a natural, helpful cure.</p>
