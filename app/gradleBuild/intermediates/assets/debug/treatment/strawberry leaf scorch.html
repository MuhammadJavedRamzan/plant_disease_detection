	<h1>Strawberry leaf scorch Treatment:</h1>
	<ul>
<li>Choose sites with full sun, good soil drainage and air circulation. This fungus requires long periods of continuous wetness to infect plants, thus any practice that promotes quick drying of leaves and fruit will reduce disease.</li>
<li>Remove weeds to improve air circulation around plants.</li>
<li>Plant in rows or narrow beds, no wider than 12-18 inches to promote good air movement in and around plants. Patches grow with time as new runners are produced. Use renovation to maintain narrow beds.</li>
<li>Renovate strawberry beds every year after harvest. The process is described in&nbsp;<em>Strawberries for the Home Garden</em>.</li>
<li>Following renovation, rake and remove old leaves.</li>
<li>Irrigate through drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly after irrigation.</li>
<li>Apply nitrogen fertilizers after renovation. Avoid early spring applications of nitrogen which encourage overly lush growth which reduces air flow promoting a moist microclimate in the canopy that is optimal for the growth of leaf scorch.</li>
</ul>
