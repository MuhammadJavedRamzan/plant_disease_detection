<h1>Tomato Early Blight Treatment:</h1>

<ol>
<li>Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.</li>
<li>Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.</li>
<li>Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.</li>
<li>Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.</li>
<li>For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.</li>
<li>Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.</li>
<li> SERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.</li>
<li>Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.</li>
<li>Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.</li>
</ol>
