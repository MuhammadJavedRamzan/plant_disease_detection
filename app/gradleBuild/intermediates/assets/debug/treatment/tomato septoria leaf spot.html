	<h1>Tomato septoria leaf spot Treatment:</h1>
	
	<ul>
<li>The best control measure for tomato blight is prevention (see below).</li>
<li>Remove and destroy infected leaves (be sure to wash your hands afterwards).</li>
<li>Once blight is present and progresses, it becomes more resistant to biofungicide and fungicide. Treat it as soon as possible and on a schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Organic fungicides.</strong>&nbsp;Treat organically with&nbsp;copper spray, which you can purchase online, at the hardware store, or home improvement center. Follow label directions. You can apply until the leaves are dripping, once a week and after each rain. Or you can treat it organically with a biofungicide like&nbsp;Serenade. Follow label instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical fungicides</strong>. Some gardeners prefer chemical fungicides, the best of which for tomatoes is&nbsp;chlorothalonil&nbsp;(sold as Fungonil, Daconil, or under other brand names. Check labels. You may also choose Mancozeb or Maneb, although these have longer wait times before you can harvest tomatoes safely than does chlorothalonil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other diseases (such as early blight, late blight, and gray leaf spot) can also be controlled by these&nbsp;biofungicides and fungicides, so application is multi-purpose.</p>
