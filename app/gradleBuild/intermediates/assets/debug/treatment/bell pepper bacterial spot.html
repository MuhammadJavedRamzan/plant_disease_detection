	<h1>Bell pepper bacterial spot Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>Crop rotation can help prevent bacterial leaf spot. Do not plant peppers or tomatoes in a location where either of these crops has been grown in the past four or five years.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, remove all crop debris from the garden and destroy it. Do not compost plant debris that may contain the disease. Once the area is clean of all visible debris, till the soil or turn it with a shovel to bury any remaining bacteria.</p>
<p>The bacterium is spread by splattering damp soil onto the leaves. Reduce the splatter by using a soaker hose and avoiding overhead watering. Stay out of the garden on wet days to avoid spreading disease on your hands and clothes.</p>
<p>Bacterial leaf spot is also spread through infected seeds. Buy certified disease-free seeds and seedlings. It&rsquo;s best not to save your own seeds if you&rsquo;ve ever had a problem with bacterial leaf spot on peppers</p>
