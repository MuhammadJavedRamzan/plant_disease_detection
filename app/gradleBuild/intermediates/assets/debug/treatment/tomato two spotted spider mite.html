	<h1>Tomato two spotted spider mite Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>Chemical pesticide use actually encourages the spread of spider mites by killing the beneficial insects that prey on them. Mites are also known to develop quick resistance to various pesticides. For these reasons, it&rsquo;s important to control mites with effective natural&nbsp;and&nbsp;organic methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Don&rsquo;t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors.</li>
<li>Use the&nbsp;Bug Blaster&nbsp;to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers.</li>
<li>Commercially available&nbsp;beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium.</li>
<li>Nuke Em, a relatively new organic insecticide containing food-grade ingredients, works fast and kills most indoor gardening pests at the egg, larvae or adult stage. Best of all, it does this without leaving a residue on the leaves that can impact flavor.</li>
<li>BotaniGard ES &nbsp;is a highly effective biological insecticide containing&nbsp;<em>Beauveria bassiana</em>, an entomopathogenic fungus that attacks a long-list of troublesome crop pests &ndash; even resistant strains! Weekly applications can prevent insect population explosions and provide&nbsp;protection equal to or better than conventional chemical pesticides.</li>
<li>Mix&nbsp;Pure Neem Oil&nbsp;with&nbsp;Coco-Wet&nbsp;and apply every 3-5 days to kill pest eggs indoors and interrupt the reproductive cycle. Make sure to spray all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves. Do&nbsp;<em>NOT</em>&nbsp;apply when temperatures&nbsp;exceed 90ËšF&nbsp;and wait at last six hours before turning lights on.</li>
<li>If populations are high, use a least-toxic, short-lived pesticide Take Down Spray,&nbsp;Doktor Doom Foggers to reduce infestations, then release&nbsp;predatory mites&nbsp;to maintain control.</li>
<li>Insecticidal soap</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;botanical insecticides&nbsp;can be used to spot treat heavily infested areas.</li>
<li>On fruit trees,&nbsp;horticultural oil&nbsp;should be applied early in the season or late in the fall to destroy overwintering eggs.</li>
<li>Dust on leaves, branches and fruit encourages mites. A mid-season hosing (or two!) to remove dust from trees is a worthwhile preventative.</li>
<li>Water stress makes both trees and garden plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Make sure your plants are properly watered.</li>
