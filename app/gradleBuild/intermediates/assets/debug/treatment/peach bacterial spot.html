	<h1>Peach bacterial spot Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>Keep your peach trees healthy by properly pruning out any diseased or dead limbs and fertilize and water as necessary. Too much nitrogen can aggravate the disease. While there are no completely successful sprays for control of this disease, chemical spray with copper based bactericide and the antibiotic oxytetracycline have some effect used preventatively. Talk to your local extension office or nursery for information. Chemical control is doubtful, however, so the best long term control is to plant resistant cultivars.</p>
