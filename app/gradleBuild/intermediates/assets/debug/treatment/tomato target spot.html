	<h1>Tomato target spot Treatment:</h1>
	
		<p>Target spot tomato treatment requires a multi-pronged approach. The following tips for treating target spot on tomatoes should help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don&rsquo;t place it on your compost pile unless you're sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.</li>
<li>Rotate crops and don&rsquo;t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year &ndash; primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course &ndash; tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.</li>
<li>Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren&rsquo;t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.</li>
<li>Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit to mulch to 3 inches or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails.</li>
<li>You can also apply fungal spray as a preventive measure early in the season, or as soon as the disease is noticed.<br /><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
