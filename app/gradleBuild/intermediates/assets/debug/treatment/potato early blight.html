	<h1>Potato early blight Treatment:</h1>
	<p>When blight is present in your garden, it can be difficult or impossible to kill entirely. However, if you increase the circulation around your plants and carefully water only when needed and only at the base of your plants, you may be able to slow the infection significantly. Pick off any diseased leaves carefully, and provide additional nitrogen and low levels of phosphorus to help potato plants recover.</p>
<p>Fungicides can be used if the disease is severe, but azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and pyraclostrobin may require multiple applications to destroy the fungus completely. Most of these chemicals must be discontinued two weeks before harvest, but pyraclostrobin can safely be used up to three days before harvest begins.</p>
<p>Prevent future outbreaks of blight by practicing a two to four year crop rotation, removing volunteer plants that may carry disease and avoiding overhead watering. When you're ready to dig your tubers, take great care not to injure them in the process. Wounds can allow post-harvest infections to take hold, ruining your stored crop.</p>
