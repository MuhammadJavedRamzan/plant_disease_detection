	<h1>Cherry powdery mildew Treatment:</h1>
	
	<p>Planting trees in a sunny area, pruning to allow good air circulation and using slow-release fertilizers can help discourage powdery mildew. However, in cases where powdery mildew already exists, many home gardeners turn to fungicides to assist with control.</p>
<p>Neem oil is a plant-based insecticide that also works as a fungicide and has the advantage of being less toxic for backyard use. However, it can injure leaves when applied in temperatures over 90 degrees or when plants are drought-stressed, as is often the case in the Sacramento area. Oil sprays deposited on foliage and stems can block the air openings of plants. This may result in leaf burn, darkened bark and dead twigs and branches.</p>
<p>Oil burn can be minimized or avoided if trees are not stressed when sprayed. Lack of moisture, extreme or sudden change in temperature, prolonged winds, disease or a heavy pest infestation can predispose plants to damage. Also, more significant damage can occur if neem oil is applied within a few weeks of a sulfur spray.</p>
