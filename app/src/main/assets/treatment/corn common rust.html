	<h1>Corn common rust Treatment:</h1>
	<p>To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance. In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant.</p>
<p>If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide. The fungicide is most effective when started at the first sign of infection. Two applications may be necessary. Contact your local extension office for advice regarding specific fungicides and their uses.</p>
